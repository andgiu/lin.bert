        "contentL":"Kuafu is an interactive story based on the Chinese myth of the same name. It is the powerful story of a giant that one day decides to catch the sun and inevitably, fails to do so. Our interactive installation lets people experience the giant’s journey. We consider this project to be an experimentation and exploration of interactive storytelling. It's not a game but more an ‘interactive poem’, a universal story that speaks to everyone.",
        "contentR":"In 2013 we entered it into the <a class=\"link link--kukuri\" data-letters=\"Google Devart\" href=\"https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/17570645\" target=\"_blank\">Google Devart</a> competition and ended up as finalists. Needless to say we were very proud of this result and have always wanted to finish the project. Time has past but the desire to create it is still intact, and we are happy to announce that Kuafu will be shown for the first time at the Awwward 2017 London Conference as a VR experience. Follow us to see the progress.",

Through simple hand gestures, you can rotate the sky, point at specific constellations to zoom in and, with a clap of the hands, navigate to a random constellation. Throughout the last couple of years this installation has been exhibited three time in slight different forms.<h2>B-Reel 5th anniversary</h2>It was first set up for B-Reel’s 5th anniversary of the London office. For this occasion we built a 9ft dome in which we mapped out the night sky. During the evening, guests could draw their own constellation, name it and attach a message to it. Their creation was then immortalised in the installation. We also added sounds so that each interaction would trigger various musical notes, transforming the whole installation into a giant synthesizer.",
        "contentR":"<h2>Stargazer International School of Geneva</h2>SÙ was part of a space themed event at the International School of Geneva, when we took 500 children for a journey through space. The installation was projected on a massive screen and each child had a chance to interact with the installation. Additionally they could draw their own constellation which was then projected during an evening event.<h2>OFF / DDD Milan 2016</h2>We were very honoured to be part of the first edition of the digital festival DDD Milan 2016, in which SÙ was displayed. For its third exhibition, we decided to create a relaxing experience. Guests could come and relax on big cushions while watching the stars and interact with the installation if they so wished.<br/>Thanks to all the people who have helped us make this project happen.",
